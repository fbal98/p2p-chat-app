# 💁🏻‍♂️ about 
This is a project for my advanced networking class. I used peer to peer networking in order to build a decenteralized chating app without any centeral servers or databases. There is a single signaling server instance which serves only one purpose; connecting peers together. once the connection has been established the server can be shut down and the connection will hold.

# ⏯ How to run frontend
1. clone the repo 
2. run `npm i`
3. run `expo run:ios` or `expo run:android`

# ⏯ How to run backend
1. `nodemon server.js` or `node server.js`


# 📝 Notes 
1. This in theory can be run on both platforms but only tested on ios.
2. The code needs a lot of cleaning on documenting (that is an issue for another time 😤)
